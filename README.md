# Dicoding: Android Intermediate Submission üì±

This is a repository that contains the source code of my submissions project at Dicoding's "Belajar Pengembangan Aplikasi Android Intermediate" course, starting from the first submission until the final submission. This course is a part of self-paced learning in the Bangkit 2022 Mobile Development learning path. I have tried to implement the best practices of the Kotlin programming language and the Android framework in this project.
